Five men walk into a suana carrying a different item each:

* Adam only brought his glasses
* Ben brought a thermos flask
* Charles brought an ipod
* David brought a magazine
* Ernest brought pencil and puzzle book

The steam was so thick the men could barely see each other, this means nobody saw who killed Adam. When the police investigated they discovered:

* Adam had been stabbed.
* No weapon could be found.
* The blood from the wound was usually thin.
* None of the suspects or their items had blood on them.
* Adam's glasses were broken.
* Ben's flask was empty.
* Charles couldn't turn on his ipod.
* David's magazine was missing a few pages.
* Ernest's pencil lost it's point

<h3>How was Adam killed?</h3>
<h6>Name the murder weapon not the method or murderer.</h6>
