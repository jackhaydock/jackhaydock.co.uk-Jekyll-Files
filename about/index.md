My name is Jack William Haydock.

I am a young englishman almost succeeding at adulthood. My main interests include IT, specifically software and web development, science, and creative media. I am also an amateur artist and I hope to publish much of my work on this site.

If you wish to make a suggestion, upload something or just tell me my work is terrible, feel free to leave a comment or contact me via these methods:
