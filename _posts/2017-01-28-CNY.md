I realised when Chinese new year was only a few hours before hand so, instead of a full comical scene like my previous holiday images, I simply traced a rooster, stuck it on a Chinese flag and pretended it was an achievement. I am tempted to do the entire Chinese zodiac (without tracing) in a similar style at a later date, if you like or loathe this idea please leave a comment below.
