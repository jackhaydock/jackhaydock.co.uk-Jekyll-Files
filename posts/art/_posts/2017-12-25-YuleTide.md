I kind of gave up on this one, there was originally meant to be people in it, but I've never been good at drawing figures. I decided that if I got too ambitious I wouldn't have time to finish it so I rounded it off as best I could and called it finished.

Despite that, I'm still pleased with this one, I didn't trace anything, it's all original. I also experimented with lots of new things instead of just the usual draw a vector line and fill it in. I played around with new filters, blending modes, different brushes and many new things that made this piece quite fun, even if the end result is not as good as the original plan (art never is).
