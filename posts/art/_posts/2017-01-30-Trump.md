As you can probably guess, I don't like this prick. He is corrupt, racist, bigoted, hypocritical, intolerant, childish and he violates the US constitution (At least some of his intended policies will) under the pretence of protecting it.

Anyway, enough politics, let's just take the p*ss out of him, because we need some escapism. Look at his lil' hands!
