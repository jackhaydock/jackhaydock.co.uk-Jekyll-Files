Yep, St. Valentine's Day is just another holiday the Roman Catholics adopted to pull more pagans into their church, when killing them wasnâ€™t enough. It was previously known as Lupercalia, a Roman fertility festival where young men dressed as animals and slapped random people with goat skin, very romantic. I admit Lupercalia was normally celebrated on the 15th, but Pope Gelasius I changed it to the 14th for some reason. 

Upon learning this, I regret not drawing that instead.

Anyway enough history, on to the image, they may not be wearing the hats but these are still depictions of the usual three holiday animals, each representing a different person (I am the black and white one usually seen in a top hat).

Give this to someone who's image and scent triggers chemical reactions in your brain to convince you to reproduce, I'm sure you humans have a word for it. They may react positively but more likely they'll just look at you weird.
