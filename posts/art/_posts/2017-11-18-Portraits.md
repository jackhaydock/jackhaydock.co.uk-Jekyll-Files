I haven't done anything with this site in a while, that's mainly because the game I'm working on, 'Horseplay' (working title), is taking a lot longer than expected. It's a lot more complicated than a basic pong clone and now that I have a full-time job, I have even less time to work on it. So it's going to be a while before a playable alpha is ready.

For now, enjoy some pixel art self portraits.

I originally made this a couple years ago, but recently I decided to redraw it and modify the layer structure to make it easier to customise.

If you have any ideas for what I could add to this, any characters I should try or would like one of your own, leave a comment or contact me.

Now have fun looking at my ugly mug.
