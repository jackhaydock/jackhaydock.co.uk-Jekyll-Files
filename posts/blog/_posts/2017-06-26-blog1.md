I have created this third blog feed for no specific reason. I just felt that if I wished to create any posts that didn't fit the others, I might as well have this feed, especially if there's a spur-of-the-moment thing or an idea so small it shouldn't require it's own dedicated feed.

There are many things that could go here such as reviews, challenges or just anything I want to say but, for whatever reason, decide not to put it on a website that people actually use. If you want something posted here or have an idea of what I could put here or elsewhere on the site let me know (Contacts in footer).
