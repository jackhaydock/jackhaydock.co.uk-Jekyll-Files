I decided to have a bit of fun and set up a gauntlet of puzzles for anyone to enjoy. The format is simple, each page will contain a puzzle that, once solved, will reveal a clue and a link to the next puzzle. Once you've solved all the puzzles, the clues will form a final puzzle. You will not be reshown the clues so be sure to note them down.
