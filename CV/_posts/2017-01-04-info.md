To anyone who has noticed alpha-numeric codes poorly hidden in the images, they are steam (sometimes Uplay or Origin) codes for games I am giving away. I have too many unredeemed games, usually through humble bundles,
and have decided, instead of just leaving them unclaimed or tediously trying to figure out who would be best to give them to, to just give them away as rewards for people who pay attention to my work (yes I'm that desperate for attention).

So long as I have spare keys for games I don't want or already have, I will hide a code in an image of every post I publish and the first person the find and claim it gets the game. A post with multiple images will likely only have one code unless specified otherwise. Most codes will be for 
[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/), though if it doesn't work try [Uplay](https://uplay.ubi.com/) or [Origin](https://www.origin.com). If none of those work, the game may have already been claimed. If you find a code and
discover it to be a game you don't want or already have, please gift it to someone or just don't claim it and let someone else find it, don't be greedy! or I'll set the cat on you, don't be fooled by his cuteness, he will kill you!
